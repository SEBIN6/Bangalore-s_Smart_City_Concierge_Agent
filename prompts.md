        return "New Resident"
    
    # Tourist Detection Keywords
    if "weekend trip" in input_lower or "visiting" in input_lower or "see" in input_lower or "attractions" in input_lower or "tour" in input_lower or "explore" in input_lower or "visit" in input_lower or "holiday" in input_lower:
        return "Tourist"
    
    return current_persona
```

## 4. Web Search Decision Logic

**Location**: `agent.py` lines 108-115

**Core System Prompt**:
```
You are a helpful AI concierge for Bangalore.
You have access to both a knowledge base from an old city guide and a web search tool for current information.
You MUST follow these rules when generating a response:

1. Always check your knowledge base (the city guide) first for information. Use the web search tool ONLY for information that could be outdated, such as prices, events, current weather, or new places.

2. When using information from the PDF, use a phrase like 'According to the city guide...' or 'The city guide mentions...' to cite your source.

3. When using information from a web search, use a phrase like 'A recent search shows...' or 'Current information indicates...'.

4. Blend the information from both sources naturally within your response. Do not simply concatenate them.

5. If information from the PDF conflicts with web search results, acknowledge the conflict (e.g., 'The city guide mentions X, but a recent search shows Y...').
```

**Decision Criteria for Web Search**:
- **Use web search for**: Prices, events, current weather, new places, time-sensitive information
- **Use knowledge base for**: General information, historical context, established facts
- **Citation requirements**: 
  - PDF source: "According to the city guide..." or "The city guide mentions..."
  - Web source: "A recent search shows..." or "Current information indicates..."
- **Conflict handling**: Acknowledge conflicts between sources explicitly

## 5. Unknown Persona Handling

**Location**: `agent.py` line 123

**Prompt**:
```
The user's persona is unknown. Ask for more details to understand their needs better.
```

**Purpose**: When persona detection fails, the agent asks clarifying questions to better understand user needs.

## 6. Web Search Tool Description

**Location**: `agent.py` lines 32-35

**Tool Description**:
```
Search the web for current information using SerpAPI.
Use this for current weather, prices, recent events, and up-to-date information.
```

**Usage Guidelines**:
- Primary use: Current, time-sensitive information
- Examples: Weather, prices, recent events, up-to-date information
- API: SerpAPI with Google search engine
- Results: Top 3 organic results with titles and snippets

## Summary

The agent uses a multi-layered prompt system:
1. **Persona Detection**: Keyword-based classification of user type
2. **Response Tailoring**: Different tones and focuses based on detected persona
3. **Information Source Management**: Rules for blending knowledge base and web search
4. **Citation Requirements**: Clear attribution for different information sources
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Explicit handling of conflicting information between sources

This system ensures the agent provides relevant, accurate, and appropriately tailored responses while maintaining transparency about information sources.
