# Bangalore Smart City Concierge

An intelligent AI concierge that provides personalized information about Bangalore, India. The agent automatically detects user personas and tailors responses using a hybrid approach combining a knowledge base with real-time web search.

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Persona Detection

The agent automatically detects whether you're a **tourist** or **new resident** based on your conversation:

**Tourist Detection Keywords:**
- "weekend trip", "visiting", "see", "attractions", "tour", "explore", "visit", "holiday"

**New Resident Detection Keywords:**
- "moving here", "work", "live", "neighborhood", "study", "job"

**How it works:**
```python
def detect_persona(user_input: str, current_persona: str) -> str:
    input_lower = user_input.lower()
    
    # New Resident Detection
    if "moving here" in input_lower or "work" in input_lower or "live" in input_lower:
        return "New Resident"
    
    # Tourist Detection  
    if "weekend trip" in input_lower or "visiting" in input_lower or "attractions" in input_lower:
        return "Tourist"
    
    return current_persona
```

**Response Tailoring:**
- **Tourists**: Enthusiastic, very concise responses (2-3 sentences max) focused on top attractions, must-eat places, and Instagram spots. Direct recommendations without follow-up questions.
- **New Residents**: Detailed, practical, and concise responses (3-4 sentences max) focused on neighborhoods, cost of living, transportation, and essential services. Comprehensive answers without follow-up questions.

### 2. Hybrid Information System: RAG + Web Search

The agent uses a sophisticated decision tree to determine when to use the knowledge base vs. web search:

```
User Query
    ‚Üì
Check Knowledge Base First
    ‚Üì
Is information time-sensitive?
    ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Use Web Search
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Current prices
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Weather updates
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Recent events
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ New places
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Use Knowledge Base
        ‚îú‚îÄ Historical facts
        ‚îú‚îÄ Established attractions
        ‚îú‚îÄ General information
        ‚îî‚îÄ Cultural context
```

**Decision Criteria:**
- **Use Knowledge Base For**: Historical facts, established attractions, general information, cultural context
- **Use Web Search For**: Current prices, weather, recent events, new places, time-sensitive information

### 3. Creative Features Added

#### A. Smart Source Attribution
The agent provides transparent citations for all information:

- **Knowledge Base**: "According to the city guide..." or "The city guide mentions..."
- **Web Search**: "A recent search shows..." or "Current information indicates..."

#### B. Natural Information Blending
Instead of concatenating sources, the agent naturally blends information:
```
‚ùå Bad: "The city guide says X. A recent search shows Y."
‚úÖ Good: "While the city guide highlights X as a must-visit spot, 
         current information indicates Y is also gaining popularity 
         among visitors."
```

#### C. Dynamic Persona Adaptation
The agent continuously monitors conversation and adapts its persona:
- Detects persona changes mid-conversation
- Provides feedback when persona is detected: "I've detected you are a Tourist. I will tailor my responses for you."
- Asks clarifying questions when persona is unclear
- Adapts response length and style based on detected persona (concise for tourists, detailed for residents)

### 4. Conflict Resolution System

When information from the knowledge base conflicts with current web search results, the agent:

1. **Acknowledges the conflict explicitly**
2. **Provides both perspectives**
3. **Explains why the difference exists**
4. **Offers the most current information**

**Example Conflict Handling:**
```
"The city guide mentions that entry to Lalbagh Botanical Garden costs ‚Çπ20, 
but a recent search shows the current entry fee is ‚Çπ50. This increase 
likely reflects recent pricing updates. For the most current information, 
I recommend checking the official website before your visit."
```

User: "I'm visiting Bangalore for a weekend trip. What should I see?"
Agent: "I've detected you are a Tourist. I will tailor my responses for you.

Perfect! Must-see: Bangalore Palace and Lalbagh Garden. Instagram spots: Cubbon Park and Commercial Street. Try MTR for dosas and Koshy's for dinner!"
```

### New Resident Interaction
```
User: "I'm moving here for work. What neighborhoods should I consider?"
Agent: "I've detected you are a New Resident. I will tailor my responses for you.

Koramangala is perfect for tech professionals - great connectivity, food scene, and 1BHK rents ‚Çπ18,000-30,000. Indiranagar is more upscale but expensive. Whitefield offers better value but is further out. Metro connects all areas."
